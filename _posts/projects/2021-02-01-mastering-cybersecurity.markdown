In 2020 I studied and followed a course to obtain certification for [CompTia Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) and [Ec-Council Ethical Hacking Associate](https://www.eccouncil.org/eccouncil-associate-programs-eha-cfa/).
In this moment I am studying for the exams prepararion, it is so hard... I hope to be able to do the exams before the summer.
