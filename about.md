<p>Welcome here!</p>
<p>
    I will talk about topics on <b>Personal Finance</b>, <b>Trading & investment</b>, <b>Computer
        Science</b> and much more.
</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    I am a software developer based in Italy and who love stuff about personal finance, trading and investment.
    I will try to write something about me in this blog like my personal opinions and some future projects, they are not
    advices!
</p>

<p>I am an IBC, this word means Italian Born Chinese, I think it is very funny as a name lol.</p>

<p>
    I started developer job about 4 years ago for passion, but living in Italy or maybe even in other places in the
    world, I realized that having a single money entrance is not enough. So I started to look something on YouTube and
    self-taught about personal finance and slowly I arrived on the trading and investment world. A new passion is born
    :D
</p>

<h4>I introduce something about my programming life</h4>
<p>
    My first programming language was C# for Microsoft system, I am mainly coding services and terminal application,
    something I had web project using ASP.NET always based to C#. Obviously I am known to use supporting language like
    HTML, CSS, SQL, etc...
    OK, that's enough... this is a blog about my projects and it is not a resume xD
</p>

<h4>Trading adventure can not miss</h4>
<p>
    Now for a speech, I think I studied a lot about anything about investment and trading I could find into the
    Internet, but more I studied more I got confused.
    I started looking for some course, but I was skeptical and finally I found it. A good mentor to start an adventure
    in this financial world, Roberto an awesome person and stock trader, he changed my mental and point of view about
    trading. Another thing about the course/community that it helped me was Warrior Trading, I saw many video of Ross
    Cameron, he is an incredible trader, for me is the top and I discovered that Roberto is also a Warrior Trading
    mentor. Wow.
</p>

<h4>Plans & Goals</h4>
<p>
    I will do my best to become a programmer and a trader, see below:
