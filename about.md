<p>I am a software developer based in Italy and who love stuff about personal finance, trading and investment.
I will try to write something about me in this blog like my personal opinions and some future projects, they are not advices!</p>
<p>I am an IBC, this word means Italian Born Cihnese, I think it is very funny as a name lol.</p>

<p>I started developer job about 4 years ago for passion, but living in Italy or maybe even in other places in the world, I realized that having a single money entrance is not enough. So I started to look something on YouTube about personal finance and slowly I arrived on the trading and investment world. A new passion is born :D</p>

<p>I introduce something about my programming skills below</p>
